# Git Commands Explained - Pushing to GitHub

## üìö Complete Guide to Git Commands

### Step 1: Initialize Git Repository
```bash
git init
```
**What it does:**
- Creates a new `.git` folder in your directory
- Turns your folder into a Git repository
- Git can now track changes in your files
- You're now on the `main` branch (default)

**Why we need it:**
- Without it, you can't use git commands
- It's like opening a bank account - you need it before depositing money

---

### Step 2: Add Remote Repository
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/Sharathirf/JOB_Search_automation.git
```
**What it does:**
- Links your local repo to GitHub
- `origin` = nickname for your GitHub repo URL
- Now you can push/pull to/from GitHub

**Think of it as:**
- Telling Git where to send your code
- Like adding a contact number to your phone

---

### Step 3: Configure Git Identity
```bash
git config user.email "sharathir@gmail.com"
git config user.name "Sharathir"
```
**What it does:**
- Sets your name and email for commits
- Git needs to know who made the changes
- Shown in commit history

**Why needed:**
- Git records WHO made each change
- Required before making commits
- You can't commit without identity

**Local vs Global:**
- `git config` = only for this repo
- `git config --global` = for all repos on your computer

---

### Step 4: Check Status
```bash
git status
```
**What it does:**
- Shows which files are:
  - Untracked (new files)
  - Modified (changed files)
  - Staged (ready to commit)
  - Not staged (changes not added)

**Output example:**
```
On branch main
Changes to be committed:
  new file:   scrape_jobs.py
  new file:   README.md
```

---

### Step 5: Add Files to Staging Area
```bash
git add .
```
**What it does:**
- Takes all files in current directory
- Adds them to the "staging area"
- Prepares them for commit

**What "staging" means:**
- Like selecting items before checkout at store
- Files are ready to be committed
- NOT saved to history yet

**Other add commands:**
- `git add scrape_jobs.py` - add single file
- `git add *.py` - add all Python files
- `git add -A` - add everything (including deleted files)

**Note:**
- `.gitignore` protects `credentials.json` from being added
- Only safe files go to GitHub

---

### Step 6: Commit Changes
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: QA/SDET Job Scraper with HR Contact Extraction"
```
**What it does:**
- Takes all staged files
- Saves a snapshot of your code
- Creates a commit with a message
- Stores it in local Git history

**What "-m" means:**
- Short for "message"
- The commit message describes what changed
- Always write clear, descriptive messages

**Commit message best practices:**
- ‚úÖ "Add job scraper with duplicate detection"
- ‚úÖ "Fix headers display issue"
- ‚ùå "fix" (too vague)
- ‚ùå "stuff" (meaningless)

---

### Step 7: Push to GitHub
```bash
git push -u origin main
```
**What it does:**
- Uploads your commits to GitHub
- `origin` = the remote repository (GitHub)
- `main` = the branch name
- `-u` = sets tracking (future pushes are just `git push`)

**Breakdown:**
- `git push` = send commits to remote
- `origin` = where to push (GitHub)
- `main` = which branch to push
- `-u` = "upstream" (link local main to origin/main)

**First time:**
- Uploads all code to GitHub
- Creates branches on GitHub

**Later:**
- Just run `git push` (no arguments needed)
- Uploads new commits only

## üîÑ Complete Workflow

### First Time (Setup)
```bash
# 1. Initialize Git
git init

# 2. Add GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git

# 3. Add files
git add .

# 4. Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# 5. Push
git push -u origin main
```

### Daily Work (Making Changes)
```bash
# 1. Edit files (scrape_jobs.py, etc.)

# 2. Check what changed
git status

# 3. Add changes
git add .

# 4. Commit with message
git commit -m "Fix duplicate detection logic"

# 5. Push to GitHub
git push
```

## üìä Git Terminology

### Repository (Repo)
- **Local repo**: On your computer
- **Remote repo**: On GitHub
- **Origin**: Nickname for remote repo (usually GitHub)

### Branch
- **main/master**: Your main code branch
- Like different versions of your code
- You can have multiple branches (feature branches)

### Commit
- A snapshot of your code at a specific time
- Like a save point in a video game
- Contains: files + message + timestamp + author

### Staging
- Preparing files before commit
- Select which changes to include
- Like packing a suitcase before trip

### Push
- Upload commits to GitHub
- Share your code with others
- Like uploading photos to cloud

### Pull
- Download changes from GitHub
- Get updates from others
- Like downloading new photos

## üéØ Common Git Commands

### View History
```bash
git log              # Show all commits
git log --oneline    # Compact view
```

### Check Status
```bash
git status           # What changed?
git diff             # Show differences
```

### Branch Management
```bash
git branch           # List branches
git branch new-feature  # Create branch
git checkout main    # Switch to main
```

### Undo Changes
```bash
git reset            # Unstage files
git checkout -- file.py  # Undo changes to file
git revert HEAD      # Undo last commit
```

### Remote Operations
```bash
git remote -v       # View remotes
git pull            # Download changes
git fetch           # Download without merging
```

---

## üö® Important Notes

### 1. Always Check Status First
```bash
git status          # See what will be pushed
```

### 2. Never Skip Commit Message
```bash
# ‚ùå Bad
git commit -m "update"

# ‚úÖ Good  
git commit -m "Add duplicate detection to scraper"
```

### 3. Check Before Push
```bash
git log --oneline   # See what you're pushing
```

### 4. Credentials Never Go to GitHub
- ‚úÖ `credentials.json` in `.gitignore`
- ‚úÖ `venv/` excluded
- ‚úÖ Only safe code is pushed

## üìù Real Example

**What we ran:**
```bash
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/Sharathirf/JOB_Search_automation.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: QA/SDET Job Scraper with HR Contact Extraction"
git push -u origin main
```

**What happened:**
1. Created `.git` folder
2. Linked to GitHub
3. Added 9 files to staging
4. Created a commit snapshot
5. Uploaded to GitHub

**Result:**
- Code is now on GitHub
- Others can see it
- You can clone it anywhere
- Version history started
